/**
 * The field seam.
 *
 * Three declarations and one registration, and each is here rather than in a package
 * for a stated reason.
 *
 * The panels and the option screens are read from `config/fields.php` and
 * `config/display-options.php`, validated to the shapes those files promise, and bound
 * under the package's `Panels` and `OptionScreens` contracts. The field package's admin
 * provider then attaches the metaboxes, the save entry, the field route, the
 * write-failure notice and the settings pages that the declarations imply - and attaches
 * none of them when a declaration is empty. So this plugin declares fields; it does not
 * write admin code, which is the whole arrangement.
 *
 * The query builder is declared here because no package binds it: `FieldQuery` needs the
 * two value tables, and only a host knows it wants them at all. It is bound under the
 * contract its consumers name, so a repository states a dependency instead of reaching
 * for a container.
 *
 * The groups themselves reach the registry on the package's own hook, in the pass the
 * package runs for that purpose: a group registered at boot time would arrive after the
 * admin screen had already asked for it.
 *
 * The stylesheet URL is this host's to name, and it is named from the package's own
 * directory rather than this plugin's: the stylesheet ships inside `vendor`, which a
 * path that assumes otherwise resolves to a URL that serves nothing. A vendor directory
 * linked outside the content root cannot be served at all, so the resolution answers
 * null when the file is not under it and lets the package fall back loudly.
