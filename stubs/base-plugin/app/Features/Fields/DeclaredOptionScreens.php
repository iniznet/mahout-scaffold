/**
 * The declared option screens, loaded once from `config/display-options.php`.
 *
 * A site-wide setting that must outlive the theme is declared here rather than
 * built as an `add_options_page()` call at file scope: the settings page, its save
 * entry and its write-failure notice are all derived from this collection, so a
 * screen that is not declared does not exist.
 *
 * The collection belongs to this plugin and the screen belongs to the package; the
 * class answers to the package's `OptionScreens` contract, which is the only key the
 * composition root binds it under.
