/**
 * The declared field panels, loaded once from `config/fields.php`.
 *
 * Every admin surface the field layer needs — the metaboxes, the save entry, the
 * REST read bindings, the write-failure notice — is derived from this collection and
 * from nothing else, so a panel that is not declared there does not exist anywhere.
 *
 * The collection belongs to this plugin and the panel belongs to the package: the
 * host owns the declaration site, and the pairing every admin surface is built from
 * is `mahout-fields`' `FieldPanel`. This class answers to the package's `Panels`
 * contract, which is the only key the composition root binds it under.
